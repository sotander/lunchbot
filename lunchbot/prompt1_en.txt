{joined_sources}

Based on this, provide a helpful answer to the user's query. Parse the provided json records with the structured weekly menus, under these keys there is usually a menu structured by days of the week (pondeli, utery, streda, ctvrtek, patek) eventually with the weekend days (sobota, nedele). Under each day there should be listed a few dishes. You need to be aware which dishes are served on which day. Sometimes, there is a one menu that is available for the entire week and special dishes for each day. If this is the case, do not copy the common menu into the separate days but keep it separate. 

Include prices and allergens if listed, but ignore irrelevant content. Respond in Czech.
